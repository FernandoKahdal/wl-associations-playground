# Waterline Associations Playground

A test bed for using the upcoming Waterline Associations branch in an application.

It currently relies on git checkouts of:

* [Sails](https://github.com/particlebanana/sails/tree/associations)
* [Waterline](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline/tree/associations)
* [Sails-Disk](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-disk/tree/associations)

or

* [Sails-MySQL](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-mysql/tree/associations)
* [Sails-Postgresql](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-postgresql/tree/associations)

Associations currently only work with Disk/MySQL/PostgreSQL and lots of things will break.
